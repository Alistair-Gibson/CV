        <p>I am a self employed artist with a keen interest in learning the skill of web development as I find the subject very
          interesting and feel it would be a worthwhile and rewarding career choice for myself. This is the first website that I
          have made and I look forward to expanding my skill set in the future.</p>

  <h3>Personal Statement</h3>
  <p>I have until recently been working in a retail manager role a job that has provided me with a lot of experience in a variety of areas. I have decided that now is the time for me to focus on expanding my skills and starting down a career path
    that I feel more actively interested in and excited about. My goal is to work in an industry that will give me opportunity's to learn and grow as a person and that has great potential for the future. To this end I have been working on courses in
    my personal time that I enjoy and that I hope give me skills that will help me achieve this goal. I have previously completed an online course that was preparation towards CompTIA A+ 220-901, this gave me an insight into hardware and networking.
    I am currently working on a full-stack Web Development course learning HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node and more, as well as a second more in depth Javascript course. From my previous positions I know that I have the drive and focus to excel in these
    fields, and the ability to manage my time, prioritise tasks and have a meticulous attention to detail. This, coupled with the enjoyment and engagement that I feel learning from these courses, gives me the confidence that I would be a valuable
    member of any team working in this industry.</p>
